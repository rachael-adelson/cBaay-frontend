My teammates and I designed and built cBay for our CS 3110 final project, a two-month long project that required us to design and implement our own idea. cBay is an online e-commerce system built for Cornell students. On cBay, students can buy, sell, and auction off their items to other Cornell students in the Ithaca area. Examples of items include textbooks, study guides, only clothing, and furniture for Collegetown apartments. 

As our final outcome, we have an extremely detailed terminal-based UI. After logging into cBay, a user is brought to our main interface, where they have the option to buy or sell an item, place a bid on an auctioned item, view their current bid list, or view their transaction history. We implemented deployed a fully functioning sever through docker and deployed our backend on a Google VN instance. Multiple users are able to interact with cBay in real time and see listings added or removed as students buy and sell items.
